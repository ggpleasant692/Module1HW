# Code Refactor Starter Code
https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram.git


# Location of Code Source in Repo
started with starter code. Unsure if it is asking the path location to this source or if this is solely used if citing borrowed source that i built upon versus refractoring.


# User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Acceptance Criteria Met When:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
